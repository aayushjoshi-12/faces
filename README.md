# Faces

### Issues
- the MSELoss caps around 1000 not able to go lower 
- after 20 epoch it gets stagnant(next time maybe we can try SmoothL1Loss)
- the loss goes down very very slowly (i guess i should try a different model this time or maybe there is a bug like last time)
- talking more practically the bounding boxes are near my head and following it but not able completely cover my whole face
- maybe it is because the dataset is not really that great
